In today's digital world, protecting your family's information is more important than ever. Here are practical steps every family can take.

## 1. Use Strong, Unique Passwords

Each family member should have:
- A unique password for every account
- Passwords that are at least 12 characters long

Consider using a family password manager to make this easier.

## 2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Add an extra layer of security to important accounts:

- Social media accounts

## 3. Regular Privacy Check-ups

Monthly family privacy reviews:
- Check who has access to shared folders
- Review app permissions on devices
- Update privacy settings on social media

## 4. Educate About Phishing

Teach family members to:
- Verify sender identity before clicking links
- Never share passwords via email or text
- Be suspicious of urgent requests for information

## 5. Keep Software Updated

Regular updates protect against security vulnerabilities:
- Enable automatic updates when possible
- Update all devices monthly
- Replace outdated devices that no longer receive updates
